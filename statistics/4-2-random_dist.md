[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*Q3 -- Exercise 4.2:  The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*  

*STEP 1: Import necessary modules*  
import numpy as np  
import thinkstats2  
import thinkplot  

*STEP 2: Generate the random sample*  
sample = np.random.random(1000)  

*STEP 3: Create and plot the PMF*    
pmf_random = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)  
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_random, label = 'Random PMF')  
thinkplot.Show(block = True)  

*STEP 4: Create and plot the CDF*  
cdf_random = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)  
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_random, label = 'Random CDF')  
thinkplot.Show(block = True)  

**The CDF is very close to a straight diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right, so I would say that yes, it looks uniform. I'm a bit less clear how to interpret the PMF here: it's almost completely covered in blue, with some vertical lines that are darker blue distributed throughout. I would have guessed that those are values that were sampled more than once, and that overlaying them on one another is what causes the darker coloring.  If that were true, though, the probability of those outcomes should be higher, and that doesn't appear to be the case in my PMF.**
